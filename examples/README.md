This directory contains minimally working example scripts and notebooks, for potential real-life use cases for perses.

## Examples

* **Single amino acid mutation:** This example lives in the `single-small-aa` subdirectory. Check its own `README.md` for more information.

* **barnase-barstar mutation:** Single residue mutation of protein-protein complex.

* **kinase mutation:** Single residue mutation of protein-ligand system.

## How to run

### Using official docker image

WIP.

This is probably the fastest way of getting to run our examples.

### Using your local python environment

If you have a local perses installation, you would just need to locate the entrypoint scripts in each of the examples' 
directory. Check their own respective `README.md` files for more information.
